The Python scripts can be ran directly on your host system (e.g., your local machine or a server) if:

Grafana is installed and accessible at the provided GRAFANA_URL (e.g., http://localhost:3000).

Python is installed (for Python scripts).

You have the necessary API key for Grafana.

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

Ensure that requests library is installed (pip install requests).


Containerized Approach:
Encapsulate everything (including dependencies) inside a container, using Docker can provide a more consistent environment and simplify the setup process, especially for environments where you might need to run the scripts on multiple machines or manage dependencies more easily.

A Dockerfile for Running the Python Script is needed. A simple Dockerfile will do.
To build and run the Python script using Docker:

Place your Python script (export.py) and the requirements.txt file in the same directory as the Dockerfile.

Build the Docker image: docker build -t grafana-dashboard-exporter-image .
Run the container:
docker run -v /path/to/dashboard/folder:/app/Dashboard grafana-dashboard-exporter
docker run --name Dashboard-python-export -v "$(PWD)/../Dashboard:/app/Dashboard" grafana-dashboard-exporter-image

This will mount the Dashboard folder on your local machine to the container and allow the script to access the exported dashboards.

In summary, You might want to use Docker in these cases:

If you need a consistent environment (e.g., Python version, installed dependencies, etc.) across different machines.

If you want to avoid polluting your local environment with dependencies that only the script needs.

If you want to automate the process and run the scripts on a cloud or virtual machine without worrying about the underlying OS.

The case is same for importing the dashboards. Use commands:
docker build -t grafana-dashboard-importer-image .
docker run --name Dashboard-python-import -v "$(PWD)/../Dashboard:/app/Dashboard" grafana-dashboard-importer-image
