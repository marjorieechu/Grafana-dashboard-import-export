The project essentially focuses on exporting grafana dashboards at intervals and importing them if need be.
Two options to automate this processes are the python script(Grafana-IE-PY) and the bash shell script(Grafana-IE-SH)
We go further to add the options of running the scripts in a local machine and in a docker environment.
