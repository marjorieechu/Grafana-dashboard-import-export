The Bash scripts can be ran directly on your host system (e.g., your local machine or a server) if:

Grafana is installed and accessible at the provided GRAFANA_URL (e.g., http://localhost:3000).

Curl is available on your system (for Bash scripts).

You have the necessary API key for Grafana.

Ensure that curl is available (usually installed by default on Linux/macOS)


Containerized Approach:
Encapsulate everything (including dependencies) inside a container, using Docker can provide a more consistent environment and simplify the setup process, especially for environments where you might need to run the scripts on multiple machines or manage dependencies more easily.
For the Bash script, we can similarly use a simple Dockerfile to run the script in a containerized environment.

To build and run the Bash script using Docker:

Place your Bash script (import.sh) in the same directory as the Dockerfile.

Build the Docker image:
docker build -t grafana-dashboard-importer .
Run the container:
docker run -v /path/to/dashboard/folder:/app/Dashboard grafana-dashboard-importer
This will allow the Bash script to access the exported dashboards folder from your local machine while running inside a Docker container.

In summary, You might want to use Docker in these cases:

If you need a consistent environment (e.g., Python version, installed dependencies, etc.) across different machines.

If you want to avoid polluting your local environment with dependencies that only the script needs.

If you want to automate the process and run the scripts on a cloud or virtual machine without worrying about the underlying OS.
